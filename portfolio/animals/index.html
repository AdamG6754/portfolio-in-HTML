        <p style="padding-right: 2em;">An interactive menagerie of various random animated pet-like animals arranged in
            a visualized array, users
            can click on the canvas and UI to effect the canvas in a multitude of ways. Created using JavaScript with
            p5.js library.

            Feed makes the animals grow when you click on them, camouflage only works on chameleons and makes them the
            same color as the background, Generate checks if the user clicked within the canvas and only creates a new
            animal at the coordinates of the mouse if the mouse is within the canvas, replace checks if the user clicks
            on an animal and -if they did- replaces the selected animal with a new one at its exact coordinates.<br><br>

            This project helped me familiarize myself with concepts like parent classes, child classes, the
            relationships between them, and what traits are among every class from the same “family” and what traits are
            unique to specific classes. As well as randomization, animation, loops, and DOM elements.
