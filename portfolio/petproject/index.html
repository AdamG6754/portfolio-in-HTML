            A game of Pong, created in JavaScript using the p5.js library. one player uses the W and S keys to move the
            left paddle up and down while the other uses the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and
            down. The paddles will loop from the top of the screen to the bottom and vice versa.<br><br>

            This is a personal project that I made to test my skills with new topics and concepts as they are introduced
            in class by making simple games. I use these projects to experiment and learn as well as create ways to
            entertain people.
